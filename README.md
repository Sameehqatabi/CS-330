#How do I approach designing software?

Designing software requires a systematic approach that starts with identifying the problem, defining the scope of the software, and specifying the requirements. Once the requirements are known, the design phase involves creating a software architecture, defining the modules, and their interfaces, and then designing the algorithms and data structures required to implement the functionality. The final step is to implement the design and test the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements.

#How do I approach developing programs?

Developing programs requires a systematic approach that starts with understanding the problem, defining the requirements, designing the solution, and implementing the design. Effective coding practices, testing, and debugging are also important aspects of program development.
